# Kulshrestha Sabha

2019/11/30

Abbington PA

## Resource committee

- the idea of the resource committee is to maintain continuity for this
- the resource committee meeting is 2 weeks before the event
- the committee meeting will be **2020/11/14**
- typically 2 out of the 3 core families should be there
- unless new members are eager to participate
- the host can invite another family as necessary
- members are
  - the person who wants to hold the committee meeting
  - the current president
  - 2 families out of the core, maximum
  - the backup host
  - a guest of the primary host
- we want to encourage the newest members
- **Megha and Chirag** are hosting the committee meeting
- **Subhadaa and Ankur** are the backup hosts

## Picnic

- the next picnic is **2020/07/11** and the rain day is **2020/07/18**
- call for volunteers for next year's picnic
  - **Renuka and Prafulla** volunteered to be the primary
  - **Shweta and Shitij** is volunteering as the backup
- picnic should be something of a longer affair, maybe something that is a day
- the old picnic format was too little time, maybe book a cabin
- having this event outside the northeast US would make it easier to travel for families
- ðŸ‘†since it's the summer and it's easier to drive

## President/Host of the sabha for 2020

- **Sushma and Anand** are the president family for the 2020

## Sabha

- the sabha will be **2020/11/28**
- **Sushama and Anand** are the primary
- **Sonali and Shival** have volunteered to be the backup
- potentially can rent a place that is not someone's home
- potentially exploring a shuttle service for the sabha
- We should try run a sabha that's outside a northeast scope
